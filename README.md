### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/es-es/) - This helped me understand how to structure and organize UI components effectively. I really liked its collaborative design tools and auto-layout features, which made prototyping much faster and more consistent.
- [Pixel Perfect](https://trazos.net/que-es-pixel-perfect-una-tecnica-para-conocer-y-aplicar-en-tus-disenos/) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand how to achieve pixel-perfect layouts. It clarified the importance of precision in UI design, and I'd recommend it to anyone learning about front-end alignment and visual accuracy.
- [Bem Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This helped me understand how to structure my CSS in a scalable and maintainable way. I really liked this naming convention because it keeps styles organized and avoids conflicts.
- [CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#targeting_media_features) - This article clarified how to make responsive designs by adapting layouts to different screen sizes. I now use them confidently for mobile-first development.
